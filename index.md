# Hi, Welcome to my User Page!

*My name is Sam Zakeri, and I am a current 4th year student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) majoring in Computer Science. I fell in love with computer science when I took my first computer science class in high school. I really enjoyed all the problem solving that coding involves.*

As John Johnson once said, 
 > "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."

## A little bit about me...

In terms of my favorite programming language, I would have to say: 
```
System.out.println("I love Java!"); 
```
One of my favorite things to do in my freetime is play basketball and watch the [NBA](https://www.nba.com).

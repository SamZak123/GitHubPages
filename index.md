# Hi, Welcome to my User Page!

*My name is Sam Zakeri, and I am a current 4th year student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) majoring in Computer Science. I fell in love with computer science when I took my first computer science class in high school. I really enjoyed all the problem solving that coding involves.*

As John Johnson once said,

## About Me

In terms of my favorite programming language, I would have to say:
